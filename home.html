            Hello, my name is Erik Costa Oliveira (E.c.O in my Projects), 
            I am a beginner in the area of programming mainly focused on the Front-End. 
        </p>
        <p class="tituloSub02">The project</p>
        <p class="sub02">
            This project is to show my skills in Design, more focused on UX and UI, 
            even more making it clear that I'm a beginner, so there will certainly be mistakes here and others there, 
            And I'll use it as a portfolio too, so in another section you'll have images of other projects I've done
        </p>
        <p class="tituloSub03">The design</p>
        <p class="sub03">
            I tried to create something with a retro style, both in the color palettes and even in the font I got inspired by some Pinterest pins for this, so in another section there will be images that inspired me
